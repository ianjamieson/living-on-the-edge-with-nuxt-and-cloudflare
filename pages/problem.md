# the problem

<!--
- what we have is
  - an event page
  - currently running on laravel
  - which is server rendered and pulls data from a database
  - although cached, we had high server costs and sometimes experienced downtime with popular events
  - due to slow scaling

- what we wanted to achieve
  - better seo
  - more reliable uptime
  - better performance
  - higher conversion

- bear in mind
  - high traffic
  - infrequent content updates
