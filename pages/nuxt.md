<!--
what is nuxt
- it's a meta framework built ontop of vue
- so if you alredy know vue then nuxt is an easy transition
- it's like react has next.js
- vue has nuxt

key
- universal rendering, by default
- that is rendering content server side
- and then the page acts like a spa with a client side router
