<!--
here you can see the cost savings
from about $6500 to $2000 per month

- downtime reduced to 0 scalability is built in with cloudflare
- load speed to average about 750ms but sometimes it's much faster



denis's comments:

since we moved, the cluster size is always at the minimum - it doesnâ€™t have to scale up ever

RDS (aws database) is a very expensive service and the cost went down 4x times
Elastic beanstalk went down 2.5x
so the total spend went down almost 3 times for us but on top of that
1. we donâ€™t have to worry or monitor anything - it just works regardless of traffic
2. there are no short periods of slow performance or no service for users when the clusters/database are scaling up
